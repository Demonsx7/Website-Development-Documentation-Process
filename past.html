                    <h2>How Did My Interest In Computers Rise?</h2>
                    <p>My interest in computers was sparked at a early age. More specifically when I was capable of playing video games. Ever since I got my first PlayStation<span class="brackets">(which was a PS3)</span>, I had a major interest in how these things worked. </p>
                    <p>This curiousity only grew larger when I was allowed to use my Dad's computer. Then Once I reached Year 8, My parents bought me my first MacBook. Since then, I've been bingeing YouTube tutorials on how to create games and applications, which is where I first learnt how to create a website.</p>
                    <p>However, I took a sudden shift in interest during Year 11, when I found out the capacity of <span id="cyber">Cyber-Security</span>. I started playing realistic Hacking Games<span class="brackets">(They were fake)</span>, and started taking smaller short Ethical Hacking courses to learn more. That's what drove me to choose the CyberSecurity Degree here at UTS.</p>

                    <h3>How was my Year 12 HSC experience?</h3>
                    <p class="smallpara">My HSC experience was daunting and fearful as well as joyous and fun. It was a really rewarding experience which allowed me to develop as a person as well as learn new skills which would benefit me for my career and overall life-time.  </p>
                    <p class="smallpara">Throughout my HSC experience, I made a variety of friends, and experienced a variety of experiences ranging from learning to drive to stressing crazy over an exam.</p>
                    <p class="smallpara">My overall HSC years were probably the best years of my life, cause I had a lot of fun, from being stupid with friends to studying real hard <span class="brackets">(I mean grinding Instagram Reels by sending my friends my entire FYP)</span>. These small experiences led to a bigger appreciation for these years within my life. </p>
