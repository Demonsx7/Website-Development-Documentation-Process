                    <h2>What Do I Want To Do In The Future?</h2>
                    <p>In the future, Once I complete my degree, I want to move into the Cyber Field mainly working for pen-testing companies where I attempt to ethically hack websites to find vunerabilities in the code in order to provide feedback and make the sites stronger. </p>
                    <p>In the near future, I also want to start an internship with a Cyber-Security company(preferably CyberCX) in order to get real world experience as well as add to my resume in order to make it more appealing to future employers. </p>
                    <p>Also in the near future, I would like to create multiple new websites and software applications both for personal use as well as creating sites for contract based things such as creating a site for a small business. I envison myself doing this, when I have fully completed my degree as well as had some real world experience in the workplace as well as fully developed my coding skills. </p>
